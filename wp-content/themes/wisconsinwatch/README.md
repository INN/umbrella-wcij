# WisconsinWatch.org child theme for Largo

This is a fairly straightforward child theme.

Of note:

- `inc/custom-post-types.php` adds a number of post types, as WCIJ uses Largo's post types taxonomy
- `inc/metaboxes.php` adds the 'Subtitle' metabox, which is used ot display secondary headlines on single posts.
- Custom series landing page template in `series-split.php`
- Header newsletter signup form in `partials/largo-header.php` with code in `js/largo-child.js`
